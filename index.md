I am a fourth-year [Electrical Engineering](https://web.ee.ntu.edu.tw/eng/index.php) student at [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/), advised by Professor [Shao-Hua Sun](https://shaohua0116.github.io/) as part of [NTU Robot Learning Lab](https://nturll.xyz/about). My current research focuses on **Programmatic Reinforcement Learning** and **Robot Learning**, aiming to enhance *interpretability*, *efficiency*, and *safety* in human-robot interaction.
   
Beyond Machine Learning, I have interned at [VICI Holdings](https://www.viciholdings.com/en/) as a **Quant Research Intern**, [EY-Parthenon](https://www.ey.com/zh_tw/services/strategy-transactions) as a **Strategy & Transactions Summer Associate**, and [Walsin Lihwa](https://www.walsin.com/en/) as a **Business Administration Intern**. Broadly, I am passionate about **AI**, **Quant Trading**, and **Business Strategy**.

<!-- **I am looking for collaboration and research assistant opportunity in Germany!** -->

## Research Interests
My research focuses on programmatic policy learning for robotics, exploring how to automatically synthesize interpretable and generalizable robot policies from demonstrations. I work at the intersection of program synthesis, reinforcement learning, and vision-language models.

- **Program Synthesis from Demonstrations:** Converting robot trajectories into executable programs using neural synthesizers and hierarchical decomposition
- **DSL (Domain-Specific Language) Invention:** Automating the creation of domain-specific languages by learning symbolic abstractions (predicates and operators) from video, enabling physically grounded policies than generic code generation
- **Bridging Symbolic and Continuous Control:** Combining high-level task planning (PDDL/TAMP) with learned low-level policies for interpretable, generalizable robot behaviors
