I am a fourth-year [Electrical Engineering](https://web.ee.ntu.edu.tw/eng/index.php) student at [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/), advised by Professor [Shao-Hua Sun](https://shaohua0116.github.io/) as part of [NTU Robot Learning Lab](https://nturll.xyz/about). My current research focuses on **Programmatic Reinforcement Learning** and **Robot Learning**, aiming to enhance *interpretability*, *efficiency*, and *safety* in human-robot interaction.
